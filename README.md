# MUSCLEMAN_Laptop-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Models
 This project is a Streamlit-based application that predicts laptop prices using machine learning models like RandomForestRegressor, LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor, and GradientBoostingRegressor. Users can input laptop specs such as brand, processor speed, RAM size, and storage, and receive an estimated price.
