This project is a web-based application developed using Python, Streamlit, and machine learning algorithms to predict laptop prices. The app allows users to select a machine learning model from options like RandomForestRegressor, LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor, and GradientBoostingRegressor. Users can input laptop specifications such as brand, processor speed, RAM size, storage capacity, screen size, and weight. The model then predicts the approximate price of the laptop.

The code uses pandas for data manipulation, and sklearn for training and evaluating the models. The dataset is split into training and test sets for better performance evaluation. The user interface is built using Streamlit, allowing an interactive experience. This project can serve as a useful example for those looking to explore machine learning in practical applications or build their own prediction models using Streamlit.

Key features:

-Supports multiple machine learning models.
-Interactive input fields for laptop specifications.
-Real-time price prediction based on user inputs.

This repository provides a practical guide for learning model training, prediction, and deploying a machine learning application using Streamlit.
